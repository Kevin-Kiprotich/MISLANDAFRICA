about=The core-service provides land degradation indicators for African Countries at two levels. At the regional level(North Africa action zone) where low and medium resolution EO are used.At the pilot site level, where(customized indicators) can be developed, using medium resoultion data(landsat time series imagery and derived vegetation indices, combined with different satellite-derived climate data). Note: MISLAND-Africa is an operational instrument relying on the international standards for reporting SDG 15.3.1 and technical approaches allowing the delivery of regular information on vegetation cover gain/loss to decision makers and environmental agencies at the first place.
